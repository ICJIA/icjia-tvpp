Please bring your own lunch and join us for the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s Lunch & Learn.

Hosted by the Authority’s Targeted Violence Prevention Program and open to researchers, practitioners, and other interested parties, this event will highlight and discuss good practices in community engagement from a Homeland Security perspective.

The speaker is Mr. Kareem Shora, JD, LLM. Kareem is Section Chief for the Community Engagement Section of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS’s longstanding engagement efforts, especially through CRCL’s engagement efforts begun in 2005, constitute some of the USG’s finest examples of sustained, substantive and comprehensive engagement with diverse domestic communities. As a result of these and other efforts, DHS has developed sophisticated mechanisms for engagement including many best practices to ensure productive communication and dialogue both with the community and within the federal government.
