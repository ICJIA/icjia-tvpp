The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority Targeted Violence Prevention Program featured Dr. Peter Simi, an expert on far-right extremist movements in the United States, at the end of June 2018 for two lectures on the current status of far-right extremist violence in the United States. The lectures were titled **"Hidden Spaces of Hate"** and exposed the ways that individuals undergo a push and pull forces in their lives that lead them into far-right extremist groups, and how those groups then prey upon individuals to engage in acts of targeted violence in furtherance of their ideological goals.

The first lecture was organized in collaboration with Loyola University Chicago with the assistance of Dr. James Marley from the School of Social Work and Dr. David Olsen from the Center for Criminal Justice Research, Policy, and Practice. The morning lecture was also co-sponsored by the Muslim Bar Association of Chicago, the Decalogue Society of Lawyers, and the Hispanic Lawyers Association of Illinois. Over 45 individuals attended the lecture including officials from the Chicago Police Department, the City of Chicago Commission on Human Relations, and the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District. Mr. David Risley, Director of Criminal Justice and Public Safety Policy for the Office of the Illinois Governor also attended. Social workers attending the morning lecture were eligible for CEU credits.

Later that evening Dr. Simi spoke at the Centre of Elgin at an event co-sponsored by various groups in Elgin. Among the co-sponsors were the Muslim Bar Association of Chicago, the City of Elgin's Commission on Human Relations, Elgin City of Peace, and the Gail Borden Public Library. On a gorgeous summer Friday night the event drew nearly 70 people for the two hour lecture and discussion. The evening session brought together Elgin's diverse community. The audience included Jews, Muslims,Christians,African Americans, Whites, Latinos, and there was a wide range of ages from senior citizens to high school students. As was the case at Loyola earlier in the day, there was a vibrant question and answer session that kept everyone in their seats through the full two hours.

"Dr. Pete Simi delivered badly-needed, important information about hate groups, which are everywhere, and he did so with clarity and compassion" said Tish Calhamer, Community Engagement Manager at the Gail Borden Public Library. She also added that "each and every community needs to address the potential or reality of hate around it, and for that, I am grateful to Junaid Afeef for bringing this exceptional discussion to Elgin."

"We chose Elgin because it is one of the communities that has really embraced the idea of prevention and early intervention" said Junaid Afeef, program director for ICJIA's Targeted Violence Prevention Program. "We want to raise awareness and help communities throughout Illinois, and when we find a receptive partner like Elgin we want to go deeper with our outreach and capacity building."

Miriam Anderson Lytle, Division Chief for Community Services and Program Development at the Gail Borden Public Library District noted that today public libraries do more than warehouse books and provide storytime programs and noted that "Gail Borden Public Library District's goal with this program was to enhance our residents' understanding of a complex issue, to support community good, and provide an opportunity for higher-level critical thinking."

ICJIA is grateful to Dr. Simi and for all of the co-sponsors and organizers that made the "Hidden Spaces of Hate" lectures possible. Dr. Simi's research suggests that far-right extremism and the violence that it promotes requires as much attention as the far more widely covered violence promoted by foreign terrorist organizations. It was also evident that hate ideology rarely precedes engagement with far-right extremist groups, and that individual social, economic, physical, and psychological issues can help push a person towards far-right extremism. If the problems or crises that push someone in this direction can be addressed, reduced, or eliminated, then the power of the pull factors will be servely lessened. This may make it far more difficult to for hate groups to recruit new members. This is one reason it is important to work with individuals even when their rhetoric may be offensive and disturbing. Vulnerable individuals who can get help can be re-directed away from far-right extremist violence.
