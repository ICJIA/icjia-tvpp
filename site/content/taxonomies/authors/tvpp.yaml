  The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authorityâ€™s Targeted Violence Prevention Program (TVPP) uses a public health approach to preventing ideologically inspired targeted violence. TVPP works with interested communities in building and sustaining community-level programs that can prevent individuals from being recruited to commit ideologically inspired targeted violence, and to help off-ramp individuals who have begun down the path but have not yet committed a crime.
  
  [Junaid M. Afeef](/authors/junaid-m-afeef) was named director of the Targeted Violence Prevention Program at the ICJIA in February 2016. Mr. Afeef has over two decades of experience in the criminal justice system.
