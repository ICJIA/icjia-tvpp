  The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s Targeted Violence Prevention Program (TVPP) uses a public health approach to preventing ideologically inspired targeted violence. TVPP works with interested communities in building and sustaining community-level programs that can prevent individuals from being recruited to commit ideologically inspired targeted violence, and to help off-ramp individuals who have begun down the path but have not yet committed a crime.
  
  Ideologically inspired targeted violence is a low frequency/high impact crime. Whether it takes the form of domestic terrorism or violent hate crimes, it is a scourge on our society, and it strains the healthy social cohesion essential to our diverse communities.
  
  Illinois is home to 23 active hate groups, and in 2014 there have were 131 cases of hate crimes in the state. Of those, 101 were cases of intimidation, assault and aggravated assault. Between March 2014 and April 2016 there were 5 individuals from Illinois charged with ISIS-related offenses.
  
  Junaid M. Afeef was named director of the Targeted Violence Prevention Program at the ICJIA in February 2016. Mr. Afeef has over two decades of experience in the criminal justice system. Early in his career he worked in the Juvenile Justice/Child Protection Division of the Cook County Public Defender’s Office. He continued working with parents and children as a bar attorney in solo private practice alongside his criminal defense and civil rights work. Mr. Afeef is very active in civic work. He co-founded the Muslim Bar Association of Chicago in 1998, and has served on various boards of religious, civic, and government entities.
