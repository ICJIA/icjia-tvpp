The Targeted Violence Prevention Program at the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority works with scholars and researchers throughout the United States and abroad to make research on targeted violence prevention, violent online political extremism, and other relevant issues more accessible to individuals and organizations in Illinois who can use this knowledge to build more effective programs within their communities.

ICJIA’s Research and Analysis Unit is led by Dr. Megan Alderden and staffed by a team of researchers who provide a wide range of research, data analysis, and coordination of outside experts to examine critical criminal justice topics and promote research that informs policy, supports evidence-based practices, and guides decision-making. They also provide technical assistance to programs supported by ICJIA-administered grant funds as those programs refine program objectives, develop data collection tools, and assess program performance.
