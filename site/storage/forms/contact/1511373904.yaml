  I saw Mr. Afeef at the Common Ground Conference in Effingham. I am enquiring about the possibility of him speaking at a Conference (Juvenile Justice) we have in Oglesby, IL at IVCC (Community College). We are in the process of deciding on a speaker or speakers. It will probably be on May 17, 2018.
  
  I need information on what it would cost us to have Mr. Afeef do a presentation that would be half a day or a whole day.
  Feel free to contact me if there is other information you would need from me.
