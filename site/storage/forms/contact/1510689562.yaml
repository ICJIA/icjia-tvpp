comment: 'I am the Emergency Preparedness Coordinator for the McLean County Health Department. We have hosted a Disaster Mental Health Conference every other year since 2010 and are in the initial planning stages for our 2018 conference. We are very interested in Targeted Violence Prevention as one of our themes. I am looking into any information you can send me regarding your program and the chance that we would be able to schedule a speaker. Thank you.  '
